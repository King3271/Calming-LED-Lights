To code this project yourself, right click on the background of the workspace and choose ‘delete all blocks’, then follow the coding video below. You can find the `forever` and `on start` blocks in the `Basic` section.

### What is it?

Turn your micro:bit into a simple digital device to help you relax by slowing and regulating your breathing using a simple animation sequence.

This project is part of a series created to offer problem-solving and prototyping activities designed to explore technology as a solution to the challenges of the Global Goals for Sustainable Development.

### How it works

* Build an animation sequence in a 'forever' loop to keep it running.
* Use the large and small built-in diamond icons to create a pulsating effect.
* Add pause blocks to slow down the animation to a relaxing pace.
* Use a longer pause in the middle of the animation, perhaps 2 seconds which is 2000 milliseconds.
* Test out your code in the MakeCode simulator to make sure it works the way you want before transferring it to your micro:bit.
